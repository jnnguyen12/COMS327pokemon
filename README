==========
CONTROLS:
==========
- in screens that are not maps, you can NAVIGATE USING ARROW KEYS AND ENTER. to back or exit, use esc (or enter, sometimes its faster that way and i dont know why??).
- to see pokemon's party, press p.
- to open bag, press B.

===========================
FUNCTIONALITIES (for 1.10):
===========================
- fixed everything that was missing in 1.09 (i know this probably doesnt count)

- basically i did the UI for everything as this assignment. the UI should closely simulate the real pokemon game, featuring text boxes and updates to the screen.
- everything also runs smoothly now.

- trainer battles:
    + npcs have a chance to switch out their pokemons.
    + an indicator is added to show how many pokemons you have left to beat the opponent.
    + when you beat the opponent, they drop level + rand() % 100 based on last fainted pokemon. 
    + you lose money when you lose.

- you are automatically transferred to pokemon center when all your pokemons faint, where there is also UI implemented (somewhat)

- you now start with lv 3, 5 pokeballs, 5 revives and 1000 pokebucks. (I am Tired of dying upon spawning for 2 seconds)

- added pokebucks, UI for buying stuff at pokemart.

- the moves arent implemented to update on leveling up. if you get both moves to be 0, you have to start over :(
