## This is a C/C++ class project surrounding the replication of a Pokemon game in ASCII art.

### All codes except the heap files and npc controls are mine. 

* **NPC mannerisms**
    - There are 7 NPC types. Hikers and rivals are supposed to chase you.
    - NPCs' and your turns are calculated using a heap.
    
* **Pokemons**
    - There are essentailly all pokemons in all games included. For simplicity, they are generated at random (lessgo Lugia lv1 starter)
    - Pokemon moves are also generated at random, and level-locked.
    
* **Gameplay**
    - In the beginning, you get to choose a pokemon (also generated at random), a set of 3 pokeballs, 3 potions, 3 revives and 2000 Pokemonies (?) will also be added.
    - You can access the bag with B, pokemon party with p, list of nearby trainers with t.
    - While walking in tall grasss, there is a 10% chance a pokemon is spawned, and can be fought and cought like a normal pokemon battle. However, no PP was implemented and type effectiveness (coming soon!)
    - You can also fight trainers the same. 
    - Upon fainting with no more pokemons left, you are transferred back to the nearest Pokemon center.
